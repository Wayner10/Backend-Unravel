#UNRAVEL

Unravel was born from the passion of its members and their experience in tourism and vacation planning. We know that many factors, such as the travel time between one accommodation or area to the next accommodation (especially if one does not know the territory), define whether that vacation was truly refreshing, exciting, or whatever one wanted from that trip.

#For the “Unravelers”

Unravel offers the “Unraveler” the best of what there is in a place they want to visit, are going to visit, or are currently visiting (in this case Costa Rica and its regions). We do it in a visual, easy to understand and fun way, without the distractions or confusion of the millions of businesses that want to sell them “something.”

#For Unravel Vendors

Unravel offers Unravel Vendors a place in the marketplace similar to businesses like Uber and Airbnb. We make it easy for small businesses to compete on exposure and marketing against larger chains that have more funds to sell their services. We allow them to set their own prices and availability with simple, fair, and transparent rates.
